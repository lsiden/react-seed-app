# React Seed App

Bare-bones starter project for a React component using Webpack, Babel, Jest, and Enzyme.

## Description

This is a bare-bones [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) seed app to get you started.
It is an alternative to the NPM module [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
developed by Facebook.

Like other React starter apps,
it relies on [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)
and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to make it browser friendly.
It also relies on [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) for writing tests.

According to its documentation,
Facebook's *create-react-app* hides the WebPack configuration file
and other details so that developers can focus on their code.
It provides a bevy of customizable turn-key features to allow you to optimize your app
and make it compatible with a wide range of browsers and mobile platforms.
Since I'm just getting started with React,
I wanted something lightweight and transparent without a lot of opinionated "magic".

I also added support for testing with [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
and [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme).
These can be replaced with another set of testing tools, if you desire,
by installing other packages and updating the line '"test": "jest"' in package.json.

If I need other features and customizations (and I probably will),
I want to add and configure them myself so that I know where all the skeletons are buried.
